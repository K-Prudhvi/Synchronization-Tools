---> There are four cpp codes for TAS,CAS,Bounded CAS,Atomic algorithms.
---> input file name is inp.txt. It should be in same directory.First line has N value. Second line has K value. Third line has rowInc value.
     Fourth line onwards matrix N*N.
---> To compile the TAS file ->  g++ Assgn3_TAS_Src-CS22BTECH11031.cpp
---> It should run by using ./a.out.
---> output file name  for TAS will be out1.txt. It contains the resultant matrix and time taken.
---> To compile the CAS file ->  g++ Assgn3_CAS_Src-CS22BTECH11031.cpp
---> It should run by using ./a.out.
---> output file name for CAS will be out2.txt. It contains the resultant matrix and time taken.
---> To compile the Bounded CAS file ->  g++ Assgn3_BoundedCAS_Src-CS22BTECH11031.cpp
---> It should run by using ./a.out.
---> output file name for Bounded CAS will be out3.txt. It contains the resultant matrix and time taken.
---> To compile the ATOMIC file ->  g++ Assgn3_ATOMIC_Src-CS22BTECH11031.cpp 
---> It should run by using ./a.out.
---> output file name for ATOMIC will be out4.txt. It contains the resultant matrix and time taken.
